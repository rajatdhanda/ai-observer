- [x] Token validation (prevent hardcoded values)
- [x] Component prop validation
- [x] Accessibility checks (alt, labels, ARIA)
- [x] Generic implementation (works with any project)

### 9. **Enhanced Dashboard** (12 Tabs)

## ðŸ§  Core Logic Principles

### 1. **Drift Detection**
- Continuously compares actual code behavior with expected patterns
- Identifies deviations from established conventions
- Tracks changes over time to detect gradual drift

### 2. **Pattern Recognition**
- Uses heuristics to identify AI-generated code patterns
- Detects common AI mistakes (over-abstraction, missing context)
- Validates against human-written baseline code

### 3. **Cross-Layer Validation**
- Ensures consistency across frontend, backend, and database
- Validates data contracts at every boundary
- Tracks data lineage through entire application

### 4. **Proactive Prevention**
- Blocks violations before they reach production
- Provides real-time feedback during development
- Suggests corrections based on best practices

### 5. **80/20 Rule Application**
- Focuses on high-impact validations
- Minimizes false positives
- Prioritizes critical issues over minor style violations
