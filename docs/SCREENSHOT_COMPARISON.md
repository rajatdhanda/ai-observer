## Root Causes:

### 1. Component Display Issue ([object Object])
```javascript
// CURRENT (BROKEN):
componentsContainer.innerHTML = allData.components.slice(0, 10).map(comp => `
  <span>${comp}</span>  // comp is an object, not a string
`).join('');

// SHOULD BE:
componentsContainer.innerHTML = allData.components.slice(0, 10).map(comp => `
  <span>${typeof comp === 'string' ? comp : comp.name || comp.componentName}</span>
`).join('');
```

### 2. Properties Not Loading
```javascript
// The properties are nested in table.typeDefinition.properties
// Not directly in table.properties
```

### 3. Query Inspector Not Rendering
```javascript
// The right panel exists in HTML but might be hidden or not populated
```
