## Summary of Current Issues:

### 🔴 Critical Issues Still Present:
1. **Table details not rendering** - The health circle and properties don't show when clicking tables
2. **Query Inspector panel missing** - Right panel not visible at all
3. **API Routes not loading** - Shows "No APIs found" when there should be data
4. **Pages not loading** - Shows (0) pages

### 🟡 Incomplete Features:
1. **Hook details** - Shows basic info but missing error chains, file paths, validation
2. **Component details** - Only shows type, missing all analysis

### ✅ Fixed Issues:
1. Component names now show properly (not [object Object])
2. Hook names display correctly

## Root Cause Analysis:

### Why Table Details Don't Show:
The SVG and properties HTML is in the code but JavaScript might be failing to render

### Why Query Inspector Missing:
The right panel div exists but might be hidden or not populated

### Why APIs/Pages Empty:
Data extraction logic not finding these items in the table data

## Components to Fix/Create:

1. **architecture-diagnostic.ts** (new) - Full diagnostic view for hooks/components
2. **api-extractor.ts** (new) - Extract API routes from table data  
3. **page-scanner.ts** (new) - Find and display pages
4. Fix working.html JavaScript to properly render table details on click
